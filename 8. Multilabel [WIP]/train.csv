1.0,Reconstructing Subject-Specific Effect Maps,"  Predictive models allow subject-specific inference when analyzing disease
related alterations in neuroimaging data. Given a subject's data, inference can
be made at two levels: global, i.e. identifiying condition presence for the
subject, and local, i.e. detecting condition effect on each individual
measurement extracted from the subject's data. While global inference is widely
used, local inference, which can be used to form subject-specific effect maps,
is rarely used because existing models often yield noisy detections composed of
dispersed isolated islands. In this article, we propose a reconstruction
method, named RSM, to improve subject-specific detections of predictive
modeling approaches and in particular, binary classifiers. RSM specifically
aims to reduce noise due to sampling error associated with using a finite
sample of examples to train classifiers. The proposed method is a wrapper-type
algorithm that can be used with different binary classifiers in a diagnostic
manner, i.e. without information on condition presence. Reconstruction is posed
as a Maximum-A-Posteriori problem with a prior model whose parameters are
estimated from training data in a classifier-specific fashion. Experimental
evaluation is performed on synthetically generated data and data from the
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Results on
synthetic data demonstrate that using RSM yields higher detection accuracy
compared to using models directly or with bootstrap averaging. Analyses on the
ADNI dataset show that RSM can also improve correlation between
subject-specific detections in cortical thickness data and non-imaging markers
of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), such as the Mini Mental State Examination Score
and Cerebrospinal Fluid amyloid-$\beta$ levels. Further reliability studies on
the longitudinal ADNI dataset show improvement on detection reliability when
RSM is used.

2.0,Rotation Invariance Neural Network,"  Rotation invariance and translation invariance have great values in image
recognition tasks. In this paper, we bring a new architecture in convolutional
neural network (CNN) named cyclic convolutional layer to achieve rotation
invariance in 2-D symbol recognition. We can also get the position and
orientation of the 2-D symbol by the network to achieve detection purpose for
multiple non-overlap target. Last but not least, this architecture can achieve
one-shot learning in some cases using those invariance.

3.0,Spherical polyharmonics and Poisson kernels for polyharmonic functions,"  We introduce and develop the notion of spherical polyharmonics, which are a
natural generalisation of spherical harmonics. In particular we study the
theory of zonal polyharmonics, which allows us, analogously to zonal harmonics,
to construct Poisson kernels for polyharmonic functions on the union of rotated
balls. We find the representation of Poisson kernels and zonal polyharmonics in
terms of the Gegenbauer polynomials. We show the connection between the
classical Poisson kernel for harmonic functions on the ball, Poisson kernels
for polyharmonic functions on the union of rotated balls, and the Cauchy-Hua
kernel for holomorphic functions on the Lie ball.

4.0,A finite element approximation for the stochastic Maxwell--Landau--Lifshitz--Gilbert system,"  The stochastic Landau--Lifshitz--Gilbert (LLG) equation coupled with the
Maxwell equations (the so called stochastic MLLG system) describes the creation
of domain walls and vortices (fundamental objects for the novel nanostructured
magnetic memories). We first reformulate the stochastic LLG equation into an
equation with time-differentiable solutions. We then propose a convergent
$\theta$-linear scheme to approximate the solutions of the reformulated system.
As a consequence, we prove convergence of the approximate solutions, with no or
minor conditions on time and space steps (depending on the value of $\theta$).
Hence, we prove the existence of weak martingale solutions of the stochastic
MLLG system. Numerical results are presented to show applicability of the
method.

5.0,Comparative study of Discrete Wavelet Transforms and Wavelet Tensor Train decomposition to feature extraction of FTIR data of medicinal plants,"  Fourier-transform infra-red (FTIR) spectra of samples from 7 plant species
were used to explore the influence of preprocessing and feature extraction on
efficiency of machine learning algorithms. Wavelet Tensor Train (WTT) and
Discrete Wavelet Transforms (DWT) were compared as feature extraction
techniques for FTIR data of medicinal plants. Various combinations of signal
processing steps showed different behavior when applied to classification and
clustering tasks. Best results for WTT and DWT found through grid search were
similar, significantly improving quality of clustering as well as
classification accuracy for tuned logistic regression in comparison to original
spectra. Unlike DWT, WTT has only one parameter to be tuned (rank), making it a
more versatile and easier to use as a data processing tool in various signal
processing applications.
