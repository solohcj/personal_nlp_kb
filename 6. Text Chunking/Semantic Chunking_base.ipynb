    "Embeddings represent the semantic meaning of a string. They don't do much on their own, but when compared to embeddings of other texts you can start to infer the relationship between chunks. I want to lean into this property and explore using embeddings to find clusters of semantically similar texts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hypothesis is that semantically similar chunks should be held together.\n",
    "\n",
    "I tried a few methods:\n",
    "1) **Heirarchical clustering with positional reward** - I wanted to see how heirarchical clustering of sentence embeddings would do. But because I chose to split on sentences, there was an issue with small short sentences after a long one. You know? (like this last sentenence). They could change the meaning of a chunk, so I added a positional reward and clusters were more likely to form if they were sentences next to each other. This ended up being ok, but tuning the parameters was slow and unoptimal.\n",
    "2) **Find break points between sequential sentences** - Next up I tried a walk method. I started at the first sentence, got the embedding, then compared it to sentence #2, then compared #2 and #3 and so on. I was looking for \"break points\" where embedding distance was large. If it was above a threshold, then I considered it the start of a new semantic section. I originally tried taking embeddings of every sentence, but this turned out to be too noisy. So I ended up taking groups of 3 sentences (a window), then got an embedding, then dropped the first sentence, and added the next one. This worked out a bit better.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll show method #2 here - It's not perfect by any means, but it's a good starting point for an exploration and I'd love to hear about how you think it could be improved.\n",
